    Similar to sign_in that instead of iterating through blobs could have just checked directly if it existed, oh well.
    if i found the image i would encode the bytes into a string so that i can return that and make it easier for myself later on
    after that, if i found no  image (if image is none) then I would return a none else i would return the encoded string
